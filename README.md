You're probably familiar with the game connect 4. This game is that game, but my friend said connect 4 was too simple, so I added a twist.

Rules that are the same:
Red goes first, Yellow goes second placing tiles on the board. 
They alternate in turns, and tiles fall to the bottom unfilled space of their column
If either player makes 4 tiles in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, that player wins
If the board fills up completely with the above condition unfulfilled, the game is a draw

New Rules:
At the start of the game, each player selects a "Sabotage Space". 
If a player places their tile on a space that is the other player's Sabotage Space, it becomes the other player's color.
If a player chooses to place a tile on their own Sabotage Space, they are allowed to pick a new Sabotage Space at the beginning of their next turn
If both players have the same Sabotage Space, the effect is cancelled out without either player knowing until either player places a tile there, at which point both players immediately pick new Sabotage Spaces.
